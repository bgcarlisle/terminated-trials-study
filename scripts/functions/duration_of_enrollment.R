#' duration_of_trial
# 
#
# This function calculates the duration of trial in days for each row of a data frame, based on the provided start and stop date columns.
# It handles different date formats and provides a warning if the format of the dates has changed, prompting a rewrite of the function.
#
# Parameters:
#   - df: The data frame containing the duration data.
#   - start_date_col: The column name indicating official start start date of the trial
#   - stop_date_col: The column name indicating date on which its corresponding clinical trial record's 
#   - overall status was first changed to "Terminated‚Äù from any other overall status in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry.
#
# Returns:
#   - The input data frame with an additional column named 'trial_days' representing the duration of trial in days.
#   - If missing values are encountered in either the start or stop date columns, the 'trial_days' value for that row will be set to "Check missing values".
#
# Notes:
#   - This function requires the 'lubridate' package.
#   - It assumes that the date formats are either day-month-year (dmy), month-day-year (mdy), or year-month-day (ymd).
#   - If the date format has changed and the parsing is unsuccessful, a warning is issued, and the 'trial_days' value for that row is set to NA.
#
# Usage example:
#   df <- duration_of_trial(df, "start_date", "stop_date")
#
